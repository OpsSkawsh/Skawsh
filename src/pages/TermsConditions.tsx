          <p className="mb-4 md:mb-6 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
            Skawsh operates as a marketplace connecting Users with independent Vendors. Skawsh does not directly perform all cleaning services â€” Vendors perform services and are independent contractors. Skawsh's role is to provide the platform for discovery, ordering, payments and limited mediation. Skawsh displays Vendor information, services and prices. Vendors set their service offerings and prices. Skawsh invoices orders with GST as applicable.

          <p className="mb-4 md:mb-6 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
            Users may cancel Orders before a driver has been assigned. Once a driver is assigned to the Order (pickup scheduled or in progress), Users may not cancel via the app. Any cancellation policy exceptions will be handled by Skawsh support discretion.
          </p>
